= Installation =
Can be installed via *easy_install yappi* , *pip install yappi* or from the source directly.

=Documentation:=
Please see [http://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/apiyappi_v092 API reference manual].
For how to use the profiler and how to interpret statistics output, see [http://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/usageyappi_v092 usage reference manual].
And finally, see [http://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/whyyappi requirements and techinal] section for why we have implemented yet another python profiler and some technical info about the internals.
